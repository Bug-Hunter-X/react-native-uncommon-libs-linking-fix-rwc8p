# React Native Third-Party Library Linking Error

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error encountered when integrating third-party libraries into React Native projects. The problem arises from issues linking native modules, which often leads to cryptic error messages.

## Bug Description

When integrating a library (e.g., a camera module), the project might fail to build or run, producing an error that is not directly related to the library's functionality.  This often occurs during linking steps involving native Android or iOS code. The core issue stems from misconfigurations, missing dependencies, or incompatibility between the library and the React Native version.

## Solution

The solution focuses on proper setup and linking.  It involves verifying that all necessary native dependencies are installed, and that the build process correctly incorporates the library's native modules.  This may include manual linking, correcting build scripts, cleaning and rebuilding the project, and double-checking library compatibility.
