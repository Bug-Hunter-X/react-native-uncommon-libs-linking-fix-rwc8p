The solution involves meticulously checking the library's documentation for platform-specific installation instructions, as these steps are often overlooked.  Additionally, cleaning the build cache can resolve temporary issues. Consider using a tool such as `react-native-clean-project`:

```bash
npx react-native-clean-project
```

Re-running the linking steps provided in the library's documentation is crucial, paying attention to details such as Android manifest modifications, Xcode project file configurations, and potentially manual linking of native code.  If you're using a package manager like CocoaPods or Gradle, ensure that these are correctly configured and the necessary dependencies are properly resolved.

If the error persists, examine the library's repository for issue reports or check for updated documentation.  The community might have already found a solution for the specific version of React Native you're using.  Finally, debugging native code might be required to identify deeper issues within the library's native modules.
